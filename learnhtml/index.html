  <p>
    A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records
    (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic
    hashes.[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the
    previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented
    as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves). The
    timestamp proves that the transaction data existed when the block was
    created. Since each block contains information about the previous block,
    they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with
    each additional block linking to the ones before it. Consequently,
    blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded,
    the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without
    altering all subsequent blocks.

    <mark>Blockchains</mark> are typically managed by a peer-to-peer (P2P)
    computer network for use as a public distributed ledger, where nodes
    collectively adhere to a consensus algorithm protocol to add and validate
    new transaction blocks. Although blockchain records are not unalterable,
    since blockchain forks are possible, blockchains may be considered secure
    by design and exemplify a distributed computing system with high Byzantine
    fault tolerance.[5]

    A blockchain was created by a person (or group of people) using the name
    (or pseudonym) Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008 to serve as the public distributed
    ledger for bitcoin cryptocurrency transactions, based on previous work by
    Stuart Haber, W. Scott Stornetta, and Dave Bayer.[6] The implementation of
    the blockchain within bitcoin made it the first digital currency to solve
    the double-spending problem without the need of a trusted authority or
    central server. The bitcoin design has inspired other applications[3][2]
    and blockchains that are readable by the public and are widely used by
    cryptocurrencies. The blockchain may be considered a type of payment
    rail.[7] 2H<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>=2H<sub>2</sub>O

  <br> David Chaum first proposed a blockchain-like protocol in his 1982 dissertation "Computer Systems Established,
  Maintained, and Trusted by Mutually Suspicious Groups."[10] Further work on a cryptographically secured chain of
  blocks was described in 1991 by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.[4][11] They wanted to implement a system wherein
  document timestamps could not be tampered with. In 1992, Haber, Stornetta, and Dave Bayer incorporated Merkle trees
  into the design, which improved its efficiency by allowing several document certificates to be collected into one
  block.[4][12] Under their company Surety, their document certificate hashes have been published in The New York Times
  every week since 1995.[13]

  The first decentralized blockchain was conceptualized by a person (or group of people) known as Satoshi Nakamoto in
  2008. Nakamoto improved the design in an important way using a Hashcash-like method to timestamp blocks without
  requiring them to be signed by a trusted party and introducing a difficulty parameter to stabilize the rate at which
  blocks are added to the chain.[4] The design was implemented the following year by Nakamoto as a core component of the
  cryptocurrency bitcoin, where it serves as the public ledger for all transactions on the network.[3]

  In August 2014, the bitcoin blockchain file size, containing records of all transactions that have occurred on the
  network, reached 20 GB (gigabytes).[14] In January 2015, the size had grown to almost 30 GB, and from January 2016 to
  January 2017, the bitcoin blockchain grew from 50 GB to 100 GB in size. The ledger size had exceeded 200 GB by early
  2020.[15]
